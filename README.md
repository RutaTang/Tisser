# Tisser

An open source alternative and lite version to Nouer for building your second brain.

## Why an lite version?

Since your second brain should not be only locked in a single or certain ecosystem, I build this alternative app for the users who are not using Apple products leading to not be able to use Nouer and also for making sure that even when Nouer is not accessiable, users can always be accessiable to theri second brain. In addition, whenever you want to transfer your second brain between Nouer and Tisser, it should be pretty simple with just exporting and importing data. 

## Why it is called lite version?

Since Apple ecosystem bring out kinds of amazying tools for us to easily intergate kinds of features into Nouer like iCloud to sync data, the features in Nouer might be more than the features of Tisser. However, we wil try our best to approach the features the Nouer has.
